# Hello-World

Hello world, My name is Richard, I'm 58 years old and retired.  
I'm a french speaking person, so be indulgent of my writing.
For several years, I have been interested in everything related to programming.
But I didn't have time to explore this area because of my work. 
Now being retired, I will try to make up for lost time
